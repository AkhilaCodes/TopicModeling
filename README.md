TOPIC MODELLING IN PYTHON WITH SPACY AND GENSIM

Topic modeling is a technique in natural language processing that identifies topics present in a collection of text documents. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a widely used probabilistic model for topic modeling. It assumes that each document is a mixture of various topics, and each topic is a mixture of words. LDA helps uncover the latent topics within a corpus and assigns each document a distribution of topics.

Topic modeling is crucial for organizing and summarizing large text datasets. It enables automated discovery of underlying themes, trends, and patterns within unstructured data. LDA, specifically, is valuable for its ability to reveal hidden structures in text, making it a powerful tool for content categorization and information retrieval.

The goal of this project was to apply topic modeling techniques, particularly LDA, to a dataset containing over 500 reports. By doing so, the project aims to unveil the key topics present in the reports, providing insights into the diverse areas covered by H2020 initiatives.

Libraries used:

1) Pandas: Pandas served as a powerful tool for data manipulation throughout the project. The library was employed to efficiently handle the dataset containing information. It facilitated tasks such as loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing, and organizing it into a structured format. Additionally, pandas aided in the seamless extraction and manipulation of relevant features, ensuring a well-prepared dataset for subsequent analysis.
2) matplotlib and seaborn: These libraries are essential for data visualization, offering a wide range of plotting functions. Matplotlib and seaborn played a crucial role in creating coherence score plots. These visualizations depicted how well the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model was able to identify coherent topics within the dataset. Through these plots, patterns and trends related to the coherence of identified topics could be visually interpreted, providing valuable insights into the performance of the LDA model.

3) pyLDAvis: This library is specifically designed for the interactive visualization of topic models like LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation). In this project, pyLDAvis was employed to visually explore and interpret the topics generated by the LDA model. It allowed for an interactive examination of the relationships between topics, the prevalence of terms within topics, and the overall coherence of the topics. This interactive visualization aided in the qualitative understanding of the LDA model’s output.

4) spacy: Spacy is a library for advanced natural language processing tasks, including lemmatization and part-of-speech tagging. Spacy’s capabilities were harnessed for in-depth linguistic analysis. It played a role in lemmatizing words, reducing them to their base or root form, which can be crucial for accurately capturing the essence of words. Additionally, part-of-speech tagging provided information about the grammatical roles of words, enhancing the depth of linguistic analysis in your project.

5) gensim: Gensim is a library for topic modeling and document similarity analysis. Gensim played a central role in building the LDA model, creating the dictionary, and generating the bag-of-words representation. The LDA model utilized gensim’s functionalities to identify latent topics within the dataset. The dictionary and bag-of-words representation are fundamental components in the topic modeling process, allowing for efficient numerical representation of text data and subsequent analysis.
 

Process Steps:

a) Data Loading: Reads H2020 reports using pandas.

b) Text Preprocessing: Utilizes spaCy for tokenization, lemmatization, and removal of irrelevant parts of speech.

c) Dictionary and Corpus Creation: Applies Gensim to create a dictionary and generate a bag-of-words representation of the corpus.

d) LDA Model Building: Constructs an LDA model using Gensim’s LdaMulticore, testing various topic numbers for optimal results.

e) Coherence Score Evaluation: Plots coherence scores to determine the optimal number of topics.

f) Optimal Model Training: Constructs the final LDA model with the identified optimal number of topics.

g) Visualization: Uses pyLDAvis to create an interactive visualization of the LDA model.
 

Possible Applications of Topic Modelling:

- Content Summarization: Automatically generates summaries of reports based on identified topics.
- Document Categorization: Facilitates the categorization of reports into relevant topics for efficient organization and retrieval.
 

Possible Improvements in this Project:

- Integration of Domain Knowledge: Incorporating domain-specific knowledge to enhance topic interpretability.
- Real-Time Processing: Adapting the model for real-time analysis as new reports become available.
